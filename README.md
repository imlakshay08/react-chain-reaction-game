# React chain reaction

A chain reaction game in React, just because.

You can try it out [here](https://sfavot.github.io/react-chain-reaction/).

Built with create-react-app, uses redux for storage, css animations, redux-undo for undoing actions.

What else can be done:
 - Optimize for mobile
 - Add animations when a ball blow
 - Maybe add some sounds
 - Use redux-persist instead of local storage
 - Make it an app with react native
 - Remote playing
 - AI
 - ...
